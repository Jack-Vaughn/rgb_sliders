# RGB Sliders for iOS

# This was written in Swift 1 back when it was just called Swift. It needs to be completely written in a newer version of Swift in order to compile on newer machines.

Use this iOS app to see what RGB values you need for the color you're wanting.  The background of the app changes as you slide the values and gives you the RGB and HEX values of what you see.
